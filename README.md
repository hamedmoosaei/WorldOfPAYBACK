# WorldOfTransactions

# A perfect combination of MVVM + RxSwift

World of Transactions is a sample swift app that has a list of transactions with the ability to filter the list.

This is a practice for using RxSwift in an MVVM project.



### Current Features:

- MVVM for architecture pattern
- All async tasks are handled with RxSwift
- RxCocoa to bind data to view
- Repository and DataSource
- Solid principles almost applied 
- Clean code rules almost applied
- All UI parts are implemented programmatically 

## TODO
- [ ] Unit Test
- [ ] Dependency Injection
